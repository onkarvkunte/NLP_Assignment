        "Summary\n",
        "Classification is one of the most important tasks of NLP and in machine learning. In NLP it often means the task of text categorization for both sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic modeling. Naïve Bayes is often one of the first classification algorithms defined in NLP.  The intuition behind a classifier is lies at the underlying probability inferred by the Bayesian Inference, which uses Baye’s rule and conditional probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a reminder on Baye’s Rule:\n",
        "P(y)=P(x)P(x)/(P(y))\n",
        "\n",
        "We are saying “what is the probability of x given y”. Naïve Bayes is a generative model because there is an input that helps the model determine what the output could be. Said differently, “to train a generative model we first collect a large amount of data in some domain (e.g., think millions of images, sentences, or sounds, etc.) and then train a model to generate data like it.” [6]\n",
        "\n",
        "So in the case of Naïve Bayes, we say given some word, what should be the class of the current word we are assessing? Contrastingly, discriminative models such as logistic regression, learn from features provided to the algorithm and then determine or predict what the class is. [7]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "With Naïve Bayes, the assumption is that the probabilities are independent. We often call the Naïve Bayes classifier the bag-of-words approach. That’s because we are essentially throwing in the collection of words into a ‘bag’, selecting a word at random, and then calculating their frequency to use in the Bayesian Inference. Thus, context – the position of words -- is ignored and despite this, it turns out that the Naïve Bayes approach can be accurate and effective at determining whether an email is spam for example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Back to bag of words. With bag of words, we assume that the position of the words are not relevant -- that dependency or context in the word phrase or sentence doesn’t matter. Relatedly, the naive Bayes assumption implies that the conditional probabilities are independent -- a rather strange assumption to make for words in a sentence! The equation for the naive Bayes classifier is outlined below:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use Naive Bayes by creating an index of words and walking through every word position in a test or corpus.\n"

Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.\n",

If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free.

Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.\n",

When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. \n",

Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to \"look before you leap\" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!\n",
